**Abstract:**\
This paper addresses performance degradation in database transaction management caused by high abort rates under Basic Timestamp Ordering (BTO). It examines how strict timestamp-based conflict resolution leads to frequent transaction rollbacks, increased retries, and wasted computation in high-contention and long-running transaction environments. The study emphasizes the limitations of BTO, including rigid conflict handling, timestamp management overhead, and the lack of effective deadlock resolution in distributed systems. By incorporating Thomas’s Write Rule, the proposed approach allows obsolete write operations to be safely ignored, thereby reducing unnecessary aborts while preserving serializability. The paper highlights the need for enhanced timestamp-based concurrency control mechanisms to improve scalability, throughput, and efficiency in high-volume database systems.
This paper addresses performance degradation in database transaction management caused by high retry counts under fixed timeout strategies in Snapshot Isolation. It examines how predefined timeout values fail to adapt to dynamic workload conditions, leading to premature transaction aborts, excessive retries, and reduced throughput in high-contention environments. The study emphasizes the role of dynamic timeout mechanisms that adjust waiting periods based on system state and transaction behavior to improve efficiency. By learning from prior executions and estimating appropriate completion windows, the proposed approach reduces unnecessary retries and lowers latency across varying node configurations. The paper highlights the need for adaptive, context-aware timeout management to enhance scalability and performance in concurrent database systems.
